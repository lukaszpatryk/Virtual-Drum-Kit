## Features

This project is an on-line drum project that runs in a web browser.

Upon launching the project, the user sees 9 square buttons set in two rows, on which there is information about which key corresponds to a given button and what percussion sound this key will produce.

A list of keys and their associated sounds.

* "W" - clap
* "S" - Hihat
* "D" - Kick
* "F" - Openhat
* "G" - Boom
* "H" - Ride
* "J" - Snare
* "K" - Tom
* "L" - Tink

The sound is triggered by pressing a button or by pressing the key assigned to it directly on the keyboard.

After pressing the button or pressing the appropriate key on the keyboard, the animation of the key that has been called is visible.

In addition to the 9 keys for making sounds, there are two additional buttons below that are only triggered by pressing them. The button with the information "Show history" is used to call up a list below containing the history of the keys called and the sounds assigned to them. After pressing it, the description on the button changes to "Hide history", and pressing it hides the list containing the history of the keys called and the sounds assigned to them. The second key is labeled "Clean history". If you press it, the history of the previously triggered sounds will be erased.

The application is responsive to 375px.
